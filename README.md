# Gameboy Advance Reproduction DEEP (A4A6) Cartridge Patches
A collection of batteryless patches for Gameboy Advance games for use on reproduction boards (DEEP/A4A6)

I've done my best to sort these and include a picture of the cartridge PCB they were pulled from
All patches were made by using the ROM ripped from a chinese bootleg and creating a patch using the VANILLA rom of the game the rom hack is made from. (So flash it to the clean vanilla rom of FireRed, Emerald, etc.)

This is what I use to patch and create patches for this repo: https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/

I don't make these patches (if that wasn't obvious) I know almost nothing about how they work, this is just a collection of patches I've ripped from cartridges

If you don't see the patch you want, you can try making a patch using this program (GBA Only): https://github.com/metroid-maniac/gba-auto-batteryless-patcher
